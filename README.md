**Graceful degradation** refers to a design strategy where a web application maintains core functionality even when some features or resources are unavailable. This ensures that users can still interact with the app under suboptimal conditions, such as a poor or lost network connection. **Service workers** support graceful degradation by intercepting network requests and serving cached responses or fallback pages when offline. This allows web apps to continue functioning reliably, improving resilience and user experience.
